"Find a Motorsai" is an app built by [fiiv.io](https://fiiv.io). It is intended to be a public service to make taking Motorsai more practical and pleasant to use.

### Our dataset is gathered manually

While you can use the app to submit a location to the app, the starting dataset is entirely unique - it was gathered manually by literally walking around Bangkok and documenting all the locations.

### We are not affiliated with the government.

Thailand's Ministry of Transportation handles licensing and regulating Motorsai drivers.

We have no direct contact with the Ministry, and operate entirely independently.

### We are not affiliated with the drivers.

Drivers are indepenent and self-employed.

We do not hire them, we do not even match you with them - we merely point out the points where they can be found.
