## Your data

We gather some limited information in order for the app to function:

 * __Your phone number__: this is used to create your account. If you choose to not create an account, you will not need to give this information and we will not gather it.
 * __Your location__: in order to show you the closest Motorsai points to you, we request your geographic location from your device. This information is stored only on your device - we do not track or keep this information beyond when the app requests the closest points from our API. This can be turned off.

## What we do with your data

Any of the data above which is sent to our service will never be used outside the context of the Motorsai app. We will not sell or pass on your information to any other party for any reason.

## Right to be forgotten

If your information (your phone number) was used to create an account, you can ask us to delete it any time. No hard feelings.

To do so, email [forgetme@motorsai.app](mailto:forgetme@motorsai.app).
