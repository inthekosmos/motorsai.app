As a foreigner especially, traffic in Thailand can seem - well, crazy. But, it's important to remember that there is a method to the madness.

Bangkok is a city of 8 million people, and while public transport manages to cover quite a bit of the city, motorcycle taxis are an always available and affordable way to get yourself to where you're going.

Safety is an important concern if you want to get around, so here are a few things to keep in mind.

### Wear a helmet

As you can likely see walking down the street, helmets are not worn by everyone. It is a ticketable offense in Thailand to not wear a helmet - however, many people still avoid it.

Motorsai drivers will typically not carry a spare helmet - some might, but don't count on it. If you know you will be taking a Motorsai, bring your own helmet. Helmets are easily obtained at any motor scooter shop!

### Hold on to the bike

Many models of motor scooters have handholds on the back of the backseat.

### Stay still, and firmly in your seat

When you move, it affects the balance of the bike. Try to avoid wiggling around or moving unless you're stopped - for example at a street light.

### Multiple passengers

While some drivers may take two passengers, it is definitely safer to take two different bikes.

In the case of a child being with you, a driver will typically not have a problem if you bring your child along.

Typically, you'll want to seat yourself at the very back and put your child in front of you.

### Licensed vs. unlicensed drivers

All Motorsai drivers who wear the orange vest are required to be licensed to be motorcycle taxi drivers by Thailand's Ministry of Transportation. However, there are people who refrain from doing this and attempt to blend in with the licensed drivers.

If you suspect a driver to not be licensed, do not use them.

### Buy health insurance

This point is not strictly for riding a motorsai, but also goes for travellers in general.

Health insurance can help you remit the cost of hospital stays or other urgent care. While reasonably priced for foreigners, the cost can definitely be difficult depending on the situation.

It is highly recommended that you have health insurance. You never know what could happen!
